# $AGI token

Open Source AI Guild will steward the funding of research and rewarding of contributors with a cryptographic token, $AGI. 

There are two primary users/holders of $AGI: 
 - Open Source contributors are given $AGI for their work. Initial distribution will be based on past contributions to Open Source AI.
 - Companies with over $1m in revenue who are using software under the COL license must acquire and stake $AGI to use the software. Through staking $AGI, value will accrue to all $AGI holders.

Commercial organizations that want to use IP owned by the Guild must stake $AGI token, in an amount proportional to their annual revenue. The exact formula can be X * min(0, revenue - 1,000,000), where X is specified by the Guild but suggesting to start at 0.001. 

For example, a company that makes $2m in ARR must stake $2k of $AGI in order to use all of IP licensed by Open Source AI Guild.

Token distribution contains:
| Role | Percentage | Vesting |
| - | - | - |
| Initial distribution | 20% | 6 months |
| DAO | 80% | 4 years |

## Initial distribution

Initial distribution of $AGI is proposed to retroactively reward open source contributors and authors of papers weighted by citations.

There will be mistakes by automated process, so we encourage people who think they were omitted to apply for retroactive funding via DAO software.

The exact calculations are specified in (technical specification document)[./tech-spec.md].
